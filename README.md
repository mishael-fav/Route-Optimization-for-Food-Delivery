# 🚗 Route Optimization for Food Delivery  
**Improving Delivery Efficiency for Food Delivery Services in Dense Urban Areas**

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing delivery routes for food delivery services operating in **dense urban areas**.  
The goal is to improve delivery efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance customer satisfaction through intelligent route planning.

The project uses **SQL** and **Power BI** to analyze historical delivery data, identify setbacks and propose optimized routing strategies.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

✅ Streamline delivery routes to **reduce lead times by 20%**  
✅ Lower operational costs by **15%** through improved route efficiency  
✅ Improve driver satisfaction by minimizing **traffic-related delays**  
✅ Provide **real-time delivery insights** to support dynamic route optimization

## 🗂 Dataset

The project utilizes four main tables:

| Table Name         | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| CustomerOrders     | Order details, delivery times, locations |
| TrafficData        | Real-time & historical traffic patterns |
| Drivers            | Driver profiles and performance metrics |
| Restaurants        | Restaurant locations and service areas |

## 👨‍💻 Tools & Technologies

- **SQL Server** — Data extraction and transformation  
- **Power BI** — Interactive dashboards & visualizations  
- **Excel** — Data cleaning & enrichment  
- **Geospatial analysis** — Map-based route visualization  

---

## 🗂 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation

- Clean and validate delivery data  
- Integrate **traffic data** with delivery timestamps  
- Map **driver routes** and restaurant coverage areas  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyze delivery times by **zone**, **restaurant**, and **driver**  
- Identify **peak traffic hours** and bottleneck areas  
- Segment drivers by **performance and efficiency**  

### 3️⃣ Route Optimization Analysis

- Calculate **optimal delivery paths** based on traffic patterns  
- Identify opportunities for **multi-order batching**  
- Model potential impact of **dynamic route adjustment**  

### 4️⃣ Dashboard & Reporting

- Build Power BI dashboards to monitor:
    - Delivery time trends  
    - Traffic impact on delivery efficiency  
    - Top-performing routes and drivers  
    - Cost savings from route optimization strategies
