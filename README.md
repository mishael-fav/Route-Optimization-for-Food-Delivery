# üöó UrbanEats Route Optimization ‚Äì Data Analytics Project
**Improving Delivery Efficiency for Food Delivery Services in Dense Urban Areas**

---

# üìñ Project Background

UrbanEats is a food delivery company operating in high-density urban areas since 2016. Its business model revolves around on-demand food delivery, supported by a fleet of independent drivers. While the company has grown significantly in terms of market share and customer reach, challenges around delivery efficiency, rising operational costs, and customer satisfaction persist.
As a Data Analyst, I was tasked with diagnosing key operational inefficiencies using SQL and Power BI, and recommending data-driven solutions to improve performance.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
* Delivery Lead Times
*	Operational Costs
*	Driver Allocation & Performance
*	Customer Experience

Targeted SQL queries used to answer specific business questions can be found here ‚Üí [Route_Optimization_for_Food_Delivery.sql](./Route_Optimization_for_Food_Delivery.sql)
An interactive Power BI dashboard used to visualize performance and test scenarios can be found here ‚Üí [Delivery_Ooptimization_Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/d596a82c-b9d9-4ecf-94dd-984edce9583f?ctid=319a61c8-ee1e-4161-8f35-b9553227afd7&pbi_source=linkShare&bookmarkGuid=2c52c005-ae0f-44e4-bc7e-56c3931703fe)

# üìÇ Data Structure & Initial Checks
The main database for this project consisted of four tables with a combined total of ~50,000 rows.
*	CustomerOrders ‚Äì Order IDs, timestamps, delivery addresses, customer satisfaction ratings.
*	Drivers ‚Äì Driver IDs, shift schedules, completed deliveries, and performance metrics.
*	TrafficData ‚Äì Road segments, time-of-day traffic intensity, congestion indexes.
*	Restaurants ‚Äì Vendor IDs, prep times, and average turnaround times.
The relationships across the tables can be visualized in the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):

# üìä Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
UrbanEats operates in a fast-paced, high-demand industry where efficient food delivery is essential to both customer retention and sustainable business growth. However, the company faces pressing challenges: prolonged delivery times, escalating operational costs, inaccurate delivery estimates, and high driver dissatisfaction.
This project introduces a data-driven route optimization framework designed to enhance delivery efficiency in dense urban environments.
UrbanEats‚Äô delivery inefficiencies were traced to three major bottlenecks:
1.	Peak-hour congestion zones (7 a.m. rush hour) consistently delay deliveries.
2.	Restaurant-level inefficiencies contribute to order turnaround delays.
3.	Uneven driver allocation on peak days drives backlogs and extended wait times.

By implementing route optimization, UrbanEats could achieve:
*	20% reduction in delivery lead times
*	15% decrease in operational costs
*	Improved customer satisfaction through accurate, real-time order updates.

# üîç Insights Deep Dive

### **Delivery Lead Times**
*	High Pending Orders: Out of 1,000 total orders, 653 (65%) remain pending, signaling a major bottleneck in order fulfillment.
*	Average Delivery Time: Average delivery time is 9.35 minutes, which looks efficient, though it only reflects completed orders and may hide delays in pending ones.
*	Delivery Performance by Hour: Peak delays occur around 7 AM, aligning with both high order volume and rush-hour traffic.
*	Restaurant Delays: Nguyen-Lopez records the highest delivery time (~4 mins), while others like Green, Malone, and Peterson show faster turnaround.
  
### **Operational Costs**
*	Traffic Hotspots: Congested areas such as Hell‚Äôs Kitchen, Gramercy, and Gashouse District increase delivery times and fuel costs, driving up overall operational expenses.
*	Order Trends by Weekday: Highest order days are Wednesday (176) and Thursday (167), which, if not managed with proper resourcing, spike costs due to overtime and inefficient routing.
  
### **Driver Allocation & Performance**
*	Top Drivers: Thomas McDonald handles the highest number of orders (36), showing strong performance but also possible over-allocation risk.
*	Workload Distribution: Driver shifts range from 6 to 8 per period, with Dawn Ferguson and Michelle Ballard at the max (8 shifts) and Cynthia Vasquez and Jennifer Williams at the min (6 shifts).
*	Drivers with Most Delay: Brian Osborne averages 0.26 hrs (~15.6 mins) delay, indicating inefficiency or challenging routes.
*	Drivers with Least Delay: Anthony Hawkins, Adam Delon, and Jacqueline Chan perform efficiently with delays as low as 0.10 hrs (~6 mins).

### **Customer Experience**
*	Pending Orders Impact: The 65% pending rate undermines reliability, leading to dissatisfaction and possible churn.
*	Top Restaurants: Nguyen-Lopez and Ryan, Alexander, and Willis generate the highest order volumes, meaning inefficiencies here directly affect more customers.
*	Real-Time Accuracy: Inaccurate or delayed estimates from bottlenecks and traffic zones reduce customer trust and repeat usage.

# Recommendations:
Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the [stakeholder team] to consider the following: 

*	Investigate the root cause of the 65% pending orders (possible dispatching delays or insufficient workforce).
*	Optimize staffing and delivery resources to handle Wednesday/Thursday peaks effectively.
*	Avoid dispatching during 7 AM traffic peaks; reroute deliveries via less congested zones.
*	Use historical traffic data to dynamically optimize routes, reducing both delivery time and fuel costs.
*	Support high-volume restaurants like Nguyen-Lopez with additional delivery capacity or efficiency tools to reduce costly bottlenecks.
*	Redistribute shifts more evenly to balance workload, prevent burnout, and increase driver engagement.
*	Investigate drivers with consistently higher delays (e.g., Brian Osborne) to identify whether route allocation or shift timing is the issue.
*	Recognize and reward low-delay drivers (Anthony Hawkins, Adam Delon, Jacqueline Chan) to encourage best practices and morale.
*	Improving real-time delivery accuracy through dynamic routing and workforce optimization to increase trust and retention.
*	Reduce pending order volume at high-demand restaurants, directly improving customer satisfaction for the largest customer segments.
